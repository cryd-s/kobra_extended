The file T5LCFG_22480K.CFG should be included in the DWIN_SET folder the first time you flash DWIN_SET to your display, to ensure that the bootloader is correctly configured to load the DGUS application files.
Once you have flashed successfully, you can (optionally) delete that file from DWIN_SET, although it does no harm to leave it there.
