      "com_interface": {
         "serial_port": "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB-Serial_Controller-if00-port0"
      }
   }

serial_port
-----------

*serial_port* needs to be adapted to match the tty inteface created for your USB-TTL adapter.

If your USB TTL was detected properly it should be listed under */dev/serial/by-id*

.. code-block:: shell
   
   $ ls /dev/serial/by-id/
   usb-Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB-Serial_Controller-if00-port0
